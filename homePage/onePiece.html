                <p>Monkey D. Luffy is the <strong>founder of the Straw Hat Pirates</strong>. Influenced by his idol Shanks, Luffy always dreamt of becoming a pirate and starting his own crew ever since he was a kid. Luffy set the aim to become the pirate king and told Shanks that he would put together a greater crew than his. That was the beautiful start of the Straw Hat pirates, and Luffy set sail on his own. Later, Luffy managed to bring powerful people to his crew and lead them stronger than ever.</p>

At first, Zoro refuses to accept the offer but ends up joining the crew after witnessing Luffy’s personality and how he rescued Zoro from the Marines. Luffy backed Zoro’s dream and wanted him to be a part of the future pirate king’s crew.</p>

This was also the dream of Sanji’s mentor Zeff. So he decided to join Luffy’s crew in their adventures across the world to fulfill his dream.</p>

                <p><span class="important">"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe</span> is the <em>helmsman</em> of the <em>Straw Hat Pirates</em> and one of the <em>Senior Officers</em> of the <em>Straw Hat Grand Fleet</em>. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the <em>Wano Country Arc</em>.</p>

                <p>Jinbe is a <em>whale shark fish-man</em> and a powerful master of <em>Fish-Man Karate</em>. His dream is to fulfill his former captain <em>Fisher Tiger</em>'s dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the <em>Sun Pirates</em>, eventually becoming its <em>second captain</em> after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the <em>Seven Warlords of the Sea</em>, though he resigned during the <em>Summit War of Marineford</em>. <em>Vegapunk</em> later <em>cloned</em> Jinbe as one of the <em>Seraphim</em>, <em>S-Shark</em>, to replace the Warlords.</p>

                <p>Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended <em>Monkey D. Luffy</em>, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the <em>New Fish-Man Pirates</em>' coup d'Ã©tat against the <em>Ryugu Kingdom</em>'s <em>Neptune Royal Family</em>. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with <em>Big Mom</em> during the <em>Whole Cake Island Arc</em>. After staying behind in <em>Totto Land</em> to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.</p>

                <p>He first gained a bounty of <img src="/references/Currency.png">76,000,000 due to him being a member of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to <img src="/references/Currency.png">250,000,000 after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at <img src="/references/Currency.png">438,000,000. Following the <em>Raid on Onigashima</em>, his bounty was increased to <img src="/references/Currency.png">1,100,000,000.</p>

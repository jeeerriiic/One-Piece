    Usopp
        Usopp is the third member to join the Straw Hat Pirates as the <strong>Sniper</strong>. He initially led the Usopp Pirates crew, but he joined Luffy’s crew.

    Vinsmoke Sanji
        Sanji is the fourth member to join the Straw Hat pirates as the <strong>Cook</strong>.

    Jinbe
        Jinbe is the ninth member to join the Straw Hat pirates as the <strong>Helmsman</strong>. Among everyone else, Jinbe was the only one we waited years to join the crew.
